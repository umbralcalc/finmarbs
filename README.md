# `lobsim` - a limit order book microsimulation

In this repository, we build an ensemble agent-based microsimulation of financial market limit order books which is inspired from extensions to the original Santa Fe model. The simulator is described in more detail in the `LOB_simulation.ipynb` notebook. Additionally, for more of a mathematical exposition, you can read this post: [umbralcalc.github.io/posts/lobsim.html](https://umbralcalc.github.io/posts/lobsim.html).
