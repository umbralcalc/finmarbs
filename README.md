# `lobsim` - a limit order book microsimulation

In this repository, we build an ensemble agent-based microsimulation of financial market limit order books which is inspired from extensions to the original Santa Fe model. The simulator is described in more detail in the `LOB_simulation.ipynb` notebook.
